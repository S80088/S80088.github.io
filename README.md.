LabProtocol: Precision Lab Timer & Checklist
LabProtocol is a specialized web-based utility designed for students and researchers in the sciences (specifically Food Science and Chemistry). It combines a high-precision protocol timer with a persistent laboratory checklist to ensure procedural accuracy during experiments.

🧪 Core Features
1. Protocol-Specific Timer
The timer is calibrated to a default 15-minute interval, a standard duration for common laboratory procedures such as:

Starch Gelatinization Analysis: Monitoring texture profiles in food samples.

Centrifugation: Standard short-cycle separation protocols.

Incubation: Short-term sample tempering.

2. State-Aware Visual Feedback
The app utilizes a "Lab Assistant" emoji system to provide at-a-glance status updates without requiring the user to read fine text:

Idle State (🧪): The system is ready for a new sample or protocol.

Running State (🔬): An active "Analyzing" animation indicates the timer is in progress.

Finished State (✅): A clear visual checkmark and audio chime signal that the protocol is complete.

3. Persistent Lab Checklist
To prevent procedural errors, the integrated checklist allows users to track their steps:

Task Management: Add specific protocol steps (e.g., "Standardize pH meter" or "Prepare Kuih Lapis sample").

Strike-through Progress: Click tasks to mark them as completed as you move through the experiment.

LocalStorage Persistence: All tasks remain saved in the browser’s memory, ensuring data isn't lost if the page is accidentally refreshed during a lab session.

🎨 Scientific Design Philosophy
Scientific Blue Palette: A clean, high-contrast UI designed for readability in bright laboratory environments.

Bento-Style Layout: Inspired by Haikal's Student Landing Page, organizing information into clear, functional blocks.

Zero-Dependency: The entire app is contained in a single HTML file using vanilla JavaScript and the Web Audio API, requiring no internet connection once loaded.

🚀 How to Use
Open app.html in any modern web browser.

Input your protocol steps into the "LAB CHECKLIST" section.

Click "Begin Analysis" to start the 15-minute countdown.

If a procedure is interrupted, use "Halt" to pause or "Clear Timer" to reset the clock.
